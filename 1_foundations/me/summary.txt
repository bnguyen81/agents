I’m an Engineering Manager with a strong background in building scalable, secure, and high-performing software systems—especially in the financial services and banking domain. Currently at Tyme Group, I work cross-functional teams delivering banking solutions on the AWS cloud, supported by modern DevOps pipelines and best-in-class engineering practices.
